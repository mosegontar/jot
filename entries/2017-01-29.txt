Just wrote a bash script that gets current date and launches vim
with a take named $CURRDATE.txt. The simplest of scripts, but nice
because if the user doesn't save the launched script then no entry
in entries/ will exist. But vim will launch an existing file if it
exists. So this eliminates, very advantangeously, the need to explicitly
*check* that a file exists. We want Vim to launch with named file regardless
of whether or it exsits, but we don't want the file to be created unless
there is actual content saved.
